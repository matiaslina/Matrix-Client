## Description

Matrix is an open network for secure, decentralized communication.

This module provides an interface to interact with a Matrix homeserver through
the *Client-Server API*. It's currenlty on active development but it's mostly
stable for day to day use.

Here's a not complete list of things that can be done:

* Login/logout
* Registration
* Synchronization of events/messages
* Send events
* Send messages
* Upload files to a home-server

There are many missing endpoints (you can check a complete checklist
[here](https://github.com/matiaslina/perl6-matrix-client/blob/master/endpoints.md)).
If you want to contribute with some endpoint check the
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

## Documentation

There's a couple of pages of documentation on the `docs/` directory. This
includes API documentation, basic usage, examples, etc.
